                <li>Eternals is a 2021 superhero film, based on the Marvel Comics race of the same name. It is the twenty-sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and the seventh installment of Phase Four. The film was released on November 5, 2021.
                     The film is directed and co-written by Chloé Zhao and stars Gemma Chan as Sersi, Richard Madden as Ikaris, Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo, Lia McHugh as Sprite, Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos, Lauren Ridloff as Makkari, Barry Keoghan as Druig, Don Lee as Gilgamesh, with Kit Harington as Dane Whitman, with Salma Hayek as Ajak, and Angelina Jolie as Thena.</li>

                <li>Marvel Television expanded the universe to network television with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC in 2013, before further expanding to streaming television on Netflix and Hulu, and cable television on Freeform. They also produced the digital series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot.
                    Marvel Studios began producing their own television series for streaming on Disney+, starting with WandaVision in 2021 as the beginning of Phase Four. The MCU also includes tie-in comics published by Marvel Comics, a series of direct-to-video short films called Marvel One-Shots, and a viral marketing campaign for the films featuring the faux news program WHIH Newsfront..</li>
                <br>
                <li>Director Chloé Zhao applies her distinctive aesthetic imprint to “Eternals,” but she can only do so much to bend the Marvel Cinematic Universe to her will. The result is a blockbuster of unusual gentle beauty that also strains to fulfill the gargantuan requirements of a massive action spectacle.
                    It is, in short, a bit of a mess. It is also—and I cannot stress this enough—2 hours and 37 minutes long. And yet because the talented, eclectic cast is so enormous and so much world-building must occur, “Eternals” ultimately feels rushed and unsatisfying. 
                    The mythology here is both dense and frequently silly, with the movie grinding to a halt around the one-hour mark for an extensive information dump. By the end, you may still be unclear as to what’s going on, but you also may not care.</li>

                Just look at my other reviews. I am a Marvel Zombie through and through. I love the brand, period. In fact, I'm typing this from the middle of my Marvel themed home office. So, when I say this movie is a mess, believe it. It's overstuffed and features decisively bad writing. 
                Everything feels shallow and the stakes are muted by insipid dialogue. Maybe the future with Eros on scene or Black Knight at the forefront can save things but judging this trash on it's own merits means 2/10 is being kind.</p>
